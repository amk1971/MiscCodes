Started Working on System Workbench(eclipse):

Started working on system workbench.We use this software to program boards and microcontrollers of stm32 family(i.e nucleo , bluepill).
I looked for proper tutorials and examples to get started for system workbench but could not find any.Since according to my mentor google and chatgpt are 
your best friends so from there I learnt how to create a project and set debug configuration etc.




Testing BME280 (temperature and humidity sensor):


I got code for testing this sensor from open source (i.e Github).I got a few errors while compiling and debugguing this code on system workbench.
A few are :

1-Setting proper Header files:
The code i copied was for another board and i was using bluepill(F103C8T6),so the files used in this code was notg for bluepill.I got an issue of wrongheader file 
I was using stm32f0xx_hal.h headers while hal library for bluepill is stm32f1xx_hal.Which i changed.

2-Wrong IDcode :
During debugging i got and error of wrong idcode (clone:0x1ba01477 & original:0x2ba01477).Changed this ID code in the file on folllowing path due to which it started working:
:
D:\System Workbench\plugins\fr.ac6.mcu.debug_2.5.0.201904120827\resources\openocd\st_scripts\target\stm32f1x

In this file i just changed idcode from 0x1ba01477 to 0x2ba01477.It started working.
