	e.g. if i2cPort is passed an argument of I2C1, the I2C1 peripheral
	is configured and if passed an argument of I2C2, the I2C2 peripheral
	is configured.
	
	2.) i2cClock: I2C peripheral clock frequency e.g. if passed an argument of
	I2C_PERIPH_FREQ_8MHZ, the selected I2C peripheral is clocked at 8MHz.
	
	3.) i2cCCR: I2C peripheral clock configuration. When this parameter is passed with 
	an argument of I2C_STANDARD_MODE_8MHZ_CCR, the I2C peripheral generates a 100kHz clock
	(standard mode) from an 8MHz input.
	
	4.) i2cTRISE: I2C peripheral maximum rise time. If this parameter is passed with
	an argument of I2C_STANDARD_MODE_8MHZ_TRISE, the I2C peripheral maximum rise time is
	configured as 1000ns (i.e. inverse of 100kHz [standard mode] ).
